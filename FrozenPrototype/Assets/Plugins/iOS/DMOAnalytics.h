    @header DMOAnalytics
    @abstract   Simple to use analytics logging library.  
    @discussion DMOAnalytics is a static library ("libtapalytics.a") for iOS which can be easily dropped into your application in order to log events to the Tapulous / Disney Mobile analytics servers, for analytics tracking purposes.  The library is designed to be as simple as possible to use.  At minimum, you can link it into your application, initialize it, and it will automatically log the following events: application start, application background, application foreground, application quit (the automatic logging can be turned off with a single switch as well).  Additionally, you can log custom events -- simple events or compound events based on key-value pairs (passed to the API in an NSDictionary). Network activity can be suspended (e.g. during performance-critical gameplay), during which any analytics events will be queued for later posting.   
		
	Be aware that you must have a pair of valid keys (UUIDs) for appKey and secret.

/*!
    @class
    @abstract    DMOAnalytics is your one-stop analytics object.
    @discussion  Initialize with one of the two designated initializers using the appropriate UUID's.  Use the singleton accessor class method "sharedAnalyticsManager" once you've initialized the object using initWithAppKey:secret: etc..  DMOAnalytics automatically logs the following events (based on NSNotifications): application start ("app_start"), application background ("app_background"), application foreground ("app_foreground"), application quit ("app_quit"). This automatic logging of the "standard events" can be turned off with the useNotificationsForStandardEvents switch. Furthermore, network access can be suspended, for instance in-game, where network activity may affect performance.  This can be done directly, using the canUseNetwork property, or alternatively, implement the DMOAnalyticsDelegate protocol (see below). Individual events can be tracked using logAnalyticsEvent: and logAnalyticsEvent:withContext: (see below for more on these). The queue of unsent analytics events can be explictly flushed to the network, using flushAnalyticsQueue.  This happens implictly when setting canUseNetwork = YES and there are queued events.

To use, set yourself as the delegate & implement the analyticsCanUseNetwork method. Return NO during any performance critical code or in places where you don't want the Analytics library to use the network.  Note that analytics events are still collected, just not sent immediately.  The next time canUseNetwork is enabled, events are flushed/sent.
